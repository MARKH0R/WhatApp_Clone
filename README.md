# WhatApp_Clone
After Twitter Clone => Threads
I have also created WhatsApp Clone.

Summers are the most important part of every student. I have started Flutter Dev, I have heard about the widgets, But it's Time to play with them.

# Mobile UI
In HomePage I have played with the TabBar and TabBarView widgets. where i have learnt that how tabs bar response on pressing the specific tab bar. I have also added PopupMenuButton unde the AppBar widget. 

In the body I have experimented the concepts of ListView.Builder, ListTile, Containers, Expended widgets, CircleAvatar and the most important concept Conditional Expression (a<b ? a:b).

To ensure the code's efficiency and readability, I organized it into separate files, providing a clear and logical flow. This modular approach not only enhanced the code's maintainability but also made it easier to understand and navigate.
